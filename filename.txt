bounce from screen:	0		(1 = true, 0 = false)	Whether objects bounce from the window borders
bounce from each other:	0		(1 = true, 0 = false)	Whether objects bounce from each other
gravity:		1		(1 = true, 0 = false)	Whether gravitation law is in force
absorbtion:		1		(1 = true, 0 = false)	Whether one object can swallow (absorb) another
restitution:		1		[0, 1] perfectly inelastic = 0 to 1 = perfectly elastic Coeficient of objects elasticity.

playing:		1 0		(1 = true, 0 = false)	Whether to read data form file and play it; Second digit toggles recording mode
playing speed:		60		in real time mode indicates 1 per how many cycle to be saved in file; in playing mode indicates how many cycles to be skipped in each visualisation step
sleep mseconds:		0		miliseconds, how long to sleep for every amount of cycles to prevent system overheat for long simulations (0 = no sleep)
cycles before sleep:	0		number of cycles before sleep to prevent system overheat for long simulations

3D:			0		(1 = 3D, 0 = 2D)	Whether visualization to be 3D or 2D.
